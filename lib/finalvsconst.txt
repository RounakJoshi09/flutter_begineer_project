The differenec between final and const is:-
1.Finalkey is runtime constance ,like you can variable with final keyword anywhere in code and may
 change also but once it is chaned then it will not be changed in runtime like after compliation
For example.
final i=0;//allowed
i=j; //allowed
i++//Not alowed beacuse after compilation after runtime its value is changing.
2.const keyword is compile time constant ,that means that if you set once variable const. then you cannot change it 
anywhere in the code.
Now there are two type of const ,beacause undrstanding that ,we have to learn one more thing.
1.a variable doesnot store any object but stores the address of object .
i.e int x=5;
it stores the adddress of 5,which is in memory.
So ,
if const i=5;
then we cannot change value of i anywhere in the code;
but if list=const [a,b,c];
then we cannot append anything into the list, like like.append(8) //we cannot do it that.
